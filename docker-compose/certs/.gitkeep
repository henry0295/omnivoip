# Certificates Directory

This directory is for SSL/TLS certificates.

## Production

Replace self-signed certificates with proper SSL certificates from:
- Let's Encrypt (certbot)
- Commercial CA
- Your organization's PKI

## Files Required

- `certificate.pem` - SSL certificate
- `private.key` - Private key
- `ca-bundle.crt` - CA certificate chain (optional)

## Generate Self-Signed (Development Only)

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout private.key \
  -out certificate.pem \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=OmniVoIP/CN=localhost"
```

## Let's Encrypt (Production)

```bash
certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem certificate.pem
cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem private.key
```

**Note**: Never commit real certificates to version control!
